    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Who created this site, and why was it made?</dt>
      <dd><p>This site was created by <a href="http://steve.org.uk/">Steve Kemp</a>.</p>
        <p>I've recently started using Amazon's Route53 service for hosting DNS, and I wanted to be sure that I fully understood how it worked, and how it could be used.</p>
        <p>This site was born as a result of that learning experience; one of the simplest things that could possibly be done with an API for DNS.</p>
        <p>I'm <a href="/interest/">considering the idea of hosting DNS</a>, via Amazons Route53 service, from GitHub repositories - If you have any interest in that please do <a href="http://steve.org.uk/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How long does it take for DNS changes to take effect?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>All the records beneath the <span class="tt">.<!-- tmpl_var name='zone' --></span> zone have a 60 second <abbr title="time to live">TTL</abbr>.</p>
        <p>This means that records <i>should</i> update in less than a minute, however local caches might misbehave and cause the updates to take longer.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I set only IPv6 or IPv4 addresses?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If the host you're updating from has <i>both</i> IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity you might find you update the wrong value.</p>
        <p>The solution is to explicitly choose which version you wish to update via the <span class="tt">-4</span> and <span class="tt">-6</span> arguments to <span class="tt">curl</span>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <pre>
          $ # This will update the IPv4 address.
          $ curl -4 http://<!-- tmpl_var name='zone' -->/set/efa6961c-f3dd-11e3-955b-...

          $ # This will update the IPv6 address.
          $ curl -6 http://<!-- tmpl_var name='zone' -->/set/efa6961c-f3dd-11e3-955b-...
        </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Alternatively you can <a href="/login/">login</a> and edit the records via your browser.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Is this service free?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>It will always be free to set the IP address for a single name, for both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
        <p>It is possible in the future that there might be an annual charge, or lifetime membership (one-off) fee which will unlock extra features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/interest/">The ability to set an MX record</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="/interest/">The ability to control multiple records with a single login.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But either way if you find this service useful you can <a href="http://github.com/skx/dhcp.io/">clone the source-code from Github</a>, and run your own instance.</p>
