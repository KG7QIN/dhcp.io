    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Who created this site, and why was it made?</dt>
      <dd><p>This site was created by <a href="https://steve.org.uk/">Steve Kemp</a>.</p>
        <p>I've recently started using Amazon's Route53 service for hosting DNS, and I wanted to be sure that I fully understood how it worked, and how it could be used.</p>
        <p>This site was born as a result of that learning experience; one of the simplest things that could possibly be done with an API for DNS.</p>


      </dd>

      <dt>How long does it take for DNS changes to take effect?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>All the records beneath the <b><span class="tt">.dhcp.io</span></b> zone have a 60 second <abbr title="time to live">TTL</abbr>.</p>
        <p>This means that records <i>should</i> update in less than a minute, however local caches might misbehave and cause the updates to take longer.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I set only IPv6 or IPv4 addresses?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If the host you're updating from has <i>both</i> IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity you might find you update the wrong value.</p>
        <p>The solution is to explicitly choose which version you wish to update via the <span class="tt">-4</span> and <span class="tt">-6</span> arguments to <span class="tt">curl</span>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <pre>
          $ # This will update the IPv4 address.
          $ curl -4 https://dhcp.io/set/efa6961c-f3dd-11e3-955b-...

          $ # This will update the IPv6 address.
          $ curl -6 https://dhcp.io/set/efa6961c-f3dd-11e3-955b-...
        </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Alternatively you can <a href="/login/">login</a> and edit the records via your browser.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Is this service free?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes it is a free service, although if you do not trust it to remain alive in the future you may <a href="https://github.com/skx/dhcp.io/">clone the source-code from Github</a>, and run your own instance.</p>
        <p>The author of this site also runs a system which allows you
        to host your own DNS zones, which interfaces with the git
        revision control system:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dns-api.com/">Git-based DNS Hosting</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to host domains, and don't want to manage the complex API involved it could be just what you're looking for.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do you cope with abuse?</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>When abuse-reports are received, if they are judged worthy, the offending account is deleted, including all other records that account held.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>My account was deleted, what do I do?</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Find a new DNS host.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I delete my account?</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>If you wish to permanently delete your account please visit the <a href="/profile/delete/">profile deletion</a> page.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Can we see our history?</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Yes, if you're signed into the site you can visit <a href="/logs/">the logs page</a>.</p>
      <p>The log-page will show you the most recent 100 changes you've applied to your record(s).</p>
