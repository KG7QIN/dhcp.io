#  This script is designed to output IPs which are the *DESTINATION*
# for more than ten hostnames.
#
#  The intention here is to catch things like:
#
#    shopa -> 1.2.3.4
#    shopb -> 1.2.3.4
#    shopc -> 1.2.3.4
#
#  We can accept multiple hostnames pointing to place-holder IP addresses
# like 127.0.0.1, but we've certainly seen a lot of spammy hostnames all
# pointing to the same online drugs/electronics/fake site.
